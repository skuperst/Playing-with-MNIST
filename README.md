**Plating with MNIST**

The project does the following:

    1. Builds a simple CNN model to classify the MNIST digits.
    2. Provides a demonstration of Checkpoints and Early Stopping.
    3. Calculates in-sample and out-of-sample accuracies, and the confusion matrix
    4. Shows the misclassified data points and the optimal CNN filters.
